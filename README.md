# Condor2LK
C2LK translates Condor Soaring Simulator task file to the LK8000 task file format. It also sets glider type, polar, map and terrain files, waypoint files and penalty zones in LK8000 profile files and settings saving time and effort. After conversion and setting water ballast LK8000 is ready to fly. If you are using LK8000 on android you will have to copy files mentioned in the C2LK manual from your PC to the android device.
